# SmoothDrawing-Swift
A smooth drawing app in Swift.

Thanks to <a href="https://www.altamiracorp.com/blog/employee-posts/capture-a-signature-on-ios">Jason Harwig's Tutorial</a> . I have learned to implement smooth drawing in iOS using objective c.

Failing to find any drawing tutorials in swift I have converted the one discussed in this tutorial in swift. 
For complete tutorial check out this <a href="http://cocoabite.com/post/108944078704/smooth-drawing-in-swift">blog post</a> on <a href="http://www.cocoabite.com">CocoaBite</a>.

This is the swift version and it demostrates how to implement smooth drawing in iOS.

##How to Use ?

Add this file to your project 
DrawableView.Swift

In Xcode's Interface builder select the view you want be able to draw on and set its class to DrawableView.swift.

And that's it.

Happy Coding
